> This is early alpha version! There's not all features yet implemented, not heavily tested with different devices and code might get large breaking changes until the first release.

[Eliot](https://github.com/ernoaapa/eliot) is a open source system for managing containerized applications on top of the IoT device with an emphasis to usability, simplicity, security and stability. Eliot gives simplified app delivery, isolation and additional security to traditional installations.

[Docker](https://www.docker.com) and [Kubernetes](https://www.kubernetes.io) have inspired heavily and if you're familiar with those, you find really easy to get started with Eliot.
