[Eliot](https://github.com/ernoaapa/eliot) is an open source system for managing containerized applications on top of the IoT device with an emphasis on usability, simplicity, security, and stability. Eliot gives simplified app delivery, isolation and additional security to traditional installations.

[Docker](https://www.docker.com) and [Kubernetes](https://www.kubernetes.io) have inspired heavily and if you're familiar with those, you find really easy to get started with Eliot.
