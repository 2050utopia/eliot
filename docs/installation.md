# Installation
At the moment Eliot is tested only on RaspberryPI 3b with [EliotOS](eliotos.md) but installing it to other environments should be pretty straight forward.

- Install [runc](https://github.com/opencontainers/runc)
- Install [containerd](https://github.com/containerd/containerd)
- Install [eliotd + eliot-discovery](https://github.com/ernoaapa/eliot)

And that's it! â˜º

If you happen to test in some new device, [please let us know!](https://github.com/ernoaapa/eliot/issues/new)
